    "# Creating Classes the Pythonic Way\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's possible to get by with python using only functions, built-in types and types from installed libraries, a more advanced programmer will want to encapsulate their data into their own types, with their own functionalities and constraints, which means making use of user-defined classes. And while it's actually easy to define classes, doing it the Pythonic way isn't always as clear, especially since the documentation for class definition can be hard to read for a newbie. This small notebook aims at explaining the main concepts surrounding classes in Python, and how they differ from how classes are done in other languages (looking at you Java!)."

They look like something right out of Java, and look very out of place, especially when built-in Python types and other libraries make liberal use of the attribute syntax. What we actually want is to be able to use plain attribute syntax, but with the control granted by getter and setter methods. It turns out that we can do just that, using the `@property` decorator. Using it to rewrite the `FancyList` class, we get the following:"

    "Dunder methods are basically reserved method _names_ that, when defined in your class, allow it (via the power of _duck typing_) to make use of built-in Python functions, operators and syntax. They are called _dunder_ methods because their names always _start and end_ with a _d_ouble _under_score, and they are sometimes called _magic_ methods because they are never actually called by a user. Instead, they are defined by the class programmer, and this definition alone is enough for a seemingly unrelated bit of the Python language to suddenly work with instances of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you've already come across dunder methods: `__init__()` is one of them. Although you define it in order to be able to pass arguments to the instantiation syntax of the class, the user never actually calls `__init__()` itself. Rather, Python itself, when seeing the `object = Class(initial_arguments)`, will first create an empty instance of that class, and _then_ call the `__init__()` method of that object, if it exists, passing it the full `initial_arguments`. By defining `__init__()` for your class, you've made it able to use a bit of Python syntax it wouldn't have been able to use otherwise.\n",

    "1. Our fancy list doesn't look as nice as a normal list when we try to print it, and;\n",
    "2. While we can concatenate a list to a fancy list, we can't do it the other way round.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the first issue, we need a way to represent our fancy list as a string that works with how Python displays things. As it turns out, there are actually _two_ ways to do so: `__repr__()` and `__str__()`. The first method is the so-called \"machine-readable\" representation of the object. Basically, it should be (with emphasis on _should_) a string representation that, when copied and pasted in a Python REPL, would recreate the object as it is at the time. Of course something like that isn't always possible, but the `__repr__()` representation should strive to achieve this goal as much as possible. In the case of our fancy list, this simply means it should return a string containing the instantiation syntax of the object (even if that object was created in a different way, like concatenation). The second method, however, is the so-called \"human-readable\" representation of the object. It makes no claims as to machine usage, and is just a way to represent the object that we will find nice to read. In fact, `__str__()` is called whenever `print()` and `str()` are used on a non-`str` object. For built-in types, the two methods usually return the same thing (in fact, if you define `__repr__()` but not `__str__()`, calls to the latter will default back to the former), but for user-defined types it's not unusual for them to differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second issue, we hit another brick wall: if we try to add a fancy list to a plain list, the operation will try to call the plain list's `__add__()` method, which we have no way to modify. Does that mean we're stuck? Of course not. The Python developers have thought of everything, and have provided the `__radd__()` method for that usecase. Basically, if you type `other + object` and `other` doesn't have an `__add__()` method that can handle `object`, Python will check whether `object` implements an `__radd__()` method before raising an error. In fact, the Python developers even provide the `__iadd__()` method to handle the `object += value` syntax, as it often warrants a separate implementation (at least for mutable types as this operation should be in place if possible).\n",

There are many other things you can do, like _class attributes_ and _class methods_, _dataclasses_ which can help you create your classes faster, _inheritance_ which allows you to handle related classes in a smart way, `__call__()`, which turns your objects into functions that can be applied on other objects, not to mention that the claim \"everything is an object\" applies to classes themselves as well. Classes, as in the blueprints themselves, are objects too, and can be manipulated in Python as such. But those are more advanced topics for another time."
